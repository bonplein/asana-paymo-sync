# asana-paymo-sync

A Clojure script that syncs projects, sections, tasks and user-task associations coming from [Asana](https://asana.com) with the time tracking service [Paymo](http://www.paymoapp.com/).

## Setup

In order for the script to be able to synchronize it needs project and user mappings in `config.clj`. Since they're both `id` based there are some CLI functions that help with filling those out.

```bash
# return projects with their name and id.
lein run asana projects

# return users with their email and id.
lein run asana users

# the same applies for paymo.
lein run paymo projects
lein run paymo users
```

## Development

Create a MySQL database which we'll use for development

```bash
mysql -uroot -e "drop database if exists asana_paymo_sync; create database asana_paymo_sync;"
mysql -uroot -D asana_paymo_sync < schema.sql
```

```bash
foreman run lein repl
```
